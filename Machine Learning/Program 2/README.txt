Assignment 3


The file nets.py runs in the following order:
no-layer network
one-layer network
three-layer network (creative)

It trains and reports for 25 epochs (for each network), though I only used
the results for epochs 21-25 for the trials (to allow them to converge).

Also, some warning messages may pop up before it does the no-layer network. It
will continue to run though.
